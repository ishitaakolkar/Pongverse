# Pongverse
Advanced Pong with AI/ML and Modern UI

This is an advanced version of the classic Pong game featuring a neural network-powered AI, using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to control the right paddle. The project also includes an updated front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a modern and interactive user interface, along with gameplay enhancements, multiplayer support, and more.

Features
AI & Machine Learning

Deep Q-Network (DQN): The AI (right paddle) is controlled by a neural network that learns optimal gameplay strategies through reinforcement learning.

Difficulty Levels: The AI's performance improves over time, with adjustable difficulty levels:

Easy: AI is less accurate and explores randomly.

Medium: AI predicts the ball's movement with some accuracy.

Hard: AI makes nearly perfect predictions.

Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment: As the player progresses, both ball speed and AI performance increase.

Gameplay & Physics

Realistic Ball Physics: The ball simulates friction, spin, and elasticity, making its movement more realistic.

Collision Detection: Ball-paddle interaction depends on where the ball hits the paddle, influencing bounce angle and speed.

Progressive Speed: The ball’s speed increases after a certain number of points, ramping up difficulty.

User Interface

Modern UI: The game features an animated start screen, responsive design, and real-time difficulty selection.

Mobile Support: The game supports mobile play, with touch controls for the left paddle and responsive design.

Scoreboard: A real-time score display tracks both the player's and AI's progress.

Game Control:

Pause/Resume: You can pause and resume the game.

Reset: Reset the game and change difficulty settings.

Sound & Visuals

Sound Effects: Customizable sound effects for ball bounces, scoring, and game start/end.

Glowing Paddle Effects: The paddles and ball have glowing effects when they make contact, adding to the visual appeal.

Multiplayer

Local Multiplayer Mode: Play against another person on the same device with separate paddle controls.

Leaderboards & High Scores

High Score Tracking: Keep track of the highest scores and the longest winning streaks.

Persistent AI Training

Saved AI Model: The AI’s learning process is saved and loaded, allowing it to improve between sessions.

Installation
Requirements

Python 3.x

Pygame (pygame)

Numpy (numpy)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pygame numpy


If you wish to run the front-end as well (HTML, CSS, JS):

Web Browser: Any modern browser (for HTML/CSS/JS front-end).

Assets

The game requires sound files to function properly. Place the following .wav files in the assets/ folder:

bounce.wav (for ball-paddle collisions)

score.wav (for scoring events)

start.wav (for the game start)

Running the Game

After installing the dependencies and placing the assets in the correct folder, run the Python script:

python pong_ai.py

For Front-End Usage (Optional)

If you prefer to play the game in a browser:

Open index.html in your browser.

You can interact with the game using touch or mouse controls for mobile/desktop support.

Additional Suggestions & Future Enhancements

Neural Network Optimization: Currently using a simple neural network model. Future enhancements may include more sophisticated architectures and training techniques like Double DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay, etc.

Multiplayer Online Support: Add the option for players to compete online.

Game Replay System: Allow users to watch their previous game replays.

User Customization: Allow the player to customize paddle size, ball speed, and colors for the paddles and ball.
